# Guru99-Banking-Project

**Introduction**

The Guru99 Bank project aims to provide net banking facility to its customers.
This release will have limited features. Over a period of time , new and new functionalities will be added to the site.

**Purpose**

My goal as the tester of this project is to create Test Documents like Test Suites, Test Plan, Integration Plan, and System Test Plan. I also do Testing of the Banking project like Exploratory Testing, Regression Testing, and Re-testing. I used Jira for Test Management and Bug Tracking and Google Sheets and Docs for Test Document creation.
